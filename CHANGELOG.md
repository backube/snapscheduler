This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)

## [Unreleased]

## [3.5.0] - 2025-05-14

### Added

- Ability to enable setting OwnerReferences on snapshots. Enabling this will
  cause the Snapshots to be deleted when the corresponding SnapshotSchedule is
  deleted. This is disabled by default.

## [3.4.0] - 2024-05-09

### Changed

- Dependency updates (including CVE fixes)
- Upgrade operator-sdk to 1.34.1

### Fixed

- Helm chart: Add `metadata.namespace` to namespaced resources for compatibility
  with ArgoCD

## [3.3.0] - 2023-09-22

### Added

- Ability to set a `priorityClassName` for the operator via Helm chart
- Ability to set pod labels and annotations for the operator via Helm chart

### Fixed

- Improve cronspec validation to allow "slash" notation

## [3.2.0] - 2022-10-10

### Added

- Ability to specify a container hash instead of just a tag when deploying via
  Helm chart

### Changed

- :warning: Helm chart now directly manages CRD installation/upgrade  
  If upgrading from 3.1.0 or earlier, manual steps are required:

  ```console
  Error: UPGRADE FAILED: rendered manifests contain a resource that already
  exists. Unable to continue with update: CustomResourceDefinition
  "snapshotschedules.snapscheduler.backube" in namespace "" exists and cannot be
  imported into the current release: invalid ownership metadata; label
  validation error: missing key "app.kubernetes.io/managed-by": must be set to
  "Helm"; annotation validation error: missing key "meta.helm.sh/release-name":
  must be set to "snapscheduler"; annotation validation error: missing key
  "meta.helm.sh/release-namespace": must be set to "backube-snapscheduler"
  ```

  The above error can be fixed by adding the required labels and annotations as
  mentioned in the error message:

  ```console
  $ kubectl label crd/snapshotschedules.snapscheduler.backube app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=Helm
  customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/snapshotschedules.snapscheduler.backube labeled

  $ kubectl annotate crd/snapshotschedules.snapscheduler.backube meta.helm.sh/release-name=snapscheduler
  customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/snapshotschedules.snapscheduler.backube annotated

  $ kubectl annotate crd/snapshotschedules.snapscheduler.backube meta.helm.sh/release-namespace=backube-snapscheduler
  customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/snapshotschedules.snapscheduler.backube annotated
  ```
