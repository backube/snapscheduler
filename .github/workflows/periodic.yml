# yamllint disable rule:line-length

# We want to have our active branches built periodically to ensure they continue
# to build correctly, and to pick up any updates to underlying packages/images.
# Unfortunately, GitHub only allows scheduled workflow runs against the
# "default" branch (main). This job, residing on the default branch, will
# trigger other jobs (across other branches) at a regular interval.
#
# Jobs triggered by this workflow:
# - Must have "workflow_dispatch" as a trigger method
# - Must either:
#   - Be on the default branch OR
#   - Have executed at least once previously
#
# The above conditions are met in our case since we're just trying to
# periodically trigger workflows that run with each PR/Push.
